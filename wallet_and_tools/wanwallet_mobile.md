The all new mobile WanWallet update for Wanchain 5.0 features a new and improved UI/UX, cross-chain Storeman node delegation and staking features, and an improved cross-chain transaction experience.

_Note: Development on both the Google Play Android version and the Apple App Store iOS version is complete, however the Apple version is still under revision according to Apple store policies, so is not yet available for download. Stay tuned for updates on the iOS version._

*   **POS Staking & Delegation**: Participating in Wanchain proof of stake with the mobile WanWallet is as easy as clicking a button
*   **Storeman Staking & Delegation:** It’s just as easy to delegate to a cross-chain Storeman node as for POS

5\. PoS Delegation
------------------

Notes:

*   You can view all current delegation information such as current and historical rewards and delegation actions for your accounts through the wallet interface
*   There is a 100 WAN minimum for delegations

**How to delegate — from the main screen:**

Staking →POS →Validators →Select a Validator →Delegate →Fill in delegation amount →Send

**Points to watch out for:**

**Quota Left:** _Check on the individual validator’s information screen that their “Quota Left” is more than the amount you wish to delegate. If it is lower than your delegation amount, you will need to choose another validator to delegate to in addition._

**Delegation Fee:** _The delegation fee is the percent of your delegation reward which is collected by the validator you stake to, a higher fee means lower rewards for you._

After completing a delegation, you may modify your delegation or withdraw it from within the wallet interface.

6\. Storeman Delegation
=======================

Notes:

*   Unlike POS nodes, Storeman nodes have an election period during which you can delegate to a node, but delegators will not receive rewards at that time — check the Storeman node’s current status to see if you can currently earn rewards or not. If the node you delegate to is not chosen, then you may immediately remove your delegation and move it to a new node.
*   Each Storeman group is limited to 21 nodes. Not every node is guaranteed a placement in the next group. Take note of when the “End Time” is in the Storeman node details page, and check at that time if your node successfully is enterned into the next group, or if the node fails and you must delegate to another Storeman node.
*   You may delegate in at any time, but you may only remove your stake and earnings at the end of a Storeman group cycle. Check “End Time” in the Storeman details page, and make certain to withdraw before that time if you wish to withdraw that cycle’s deposit and rewards.

How to delegate:
----------------

From the main screen:

Staking →OpenStoreman→Storeman→Select a Validator →Delegate In →Fill in delegation amount →Send
