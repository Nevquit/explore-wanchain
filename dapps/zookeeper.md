# A Brief Intro to a New DApp on Wanchain, ZooKeeper

ZooKeeper is a brand new project built as a Wanchain Dapp. It is entirely conceived and developed by passionate members of the community with some collaboration from the Wanchain team devs.

We will now reveal a small part of the numerous exciting developments coming to the ZooKeeper dApp.

## **Introduction**

What if we said, this DApp will provide **dual farming** on Wanchain. How does that sound? Good right? Yeah, of course!

So, how about dual mining with **boosted rewards** for locking up your tokens? Even better!

Well, how about dual mining, boosted rewards, and enhancing your rewards further by **using an NFT**?

*   **NFTs**

But let us take this one step further. How about dual mining rewards, boosted by locking up tokens, enhancing with NFT’s and, what if you were able to **craft super NFT**s by combining two that you already own to create a super NFT that will help combine and super-enhance your rewards.

Yes, All on the Wanchain blockchain!

A DApp that does all of the above, has a utility token AND works hand in hand with [WanSwap](https://wanswap.finance)?

Yeah. We think it sounds too good to be true too. But it is true, and it’s almost ready to be unleashed!

To accomplish this, designers, developers, and community members across multiple projects have collaborated to deliver what we think will be one of, if not THE best gamified NFT based, yield mining dApp in this space. Honestly, it looks so good, we don’t think there is anything in the crypto space like it at the moment and it’s so awesome, we think it’ll blow your socks off!

## Dynamic Market Cap

ZooKeeper Tokenomics Explained

In this article we will elaborate upon ZooKeeper tokenomics and the reasons for choosing to use a ‘dynamic market cap’ strategy for the ZOO Token.

ZooKeeper concluded that it would be a better decision to use a dynamic market cap as its tokenomics model due to the use of boost, burn, and locktime mechanisms within its farming environment. This means that all 10 ZOO minted per block are not impacted by any additional features such as Boost Reward and/or Locktime Period. These extra parameters will be added gradually and depend solely on community usage and ZOO incineration amounts.

**The MIN CAP is estimated as follows:**  
(total minted ZOO over 24 months + 23% OTT (Over The Top))

*   Total ZOO minted over 2 years is: 63,072,000 seconds (24 months) divided by 5 (1 block every 5s) = 12,614,400 blocks. Thus giving us: 12,614,400 x 10 ZOO per block = **126,144,000 ZOO**.
*   Add to this the OTT of 23% (see breakdown further down for details) which is: 126,144,000 x 0.23 = **29,013,120 ZOO**
*   This gives us an estimated minimum cap total of **155,157,120 ZOO**, minted over a period of 24 months.

**The MAX CAP is estimated as follows:**  
(total minted ZOO over 24 months + Maximum Boost rate) + 23% OTT

*   Total ZOO minted over 2 years is: 63,072,000 seconds (24 months) divided by 5 (1 block every 5s) = 12,614,400 blocks. Thus giving us: 12,614,400 x 10 ZOO per block = **126,144,000 ZOO**.
*   Maximum Boost Rate 153.30 % (84.30% max NFT Boost + 69% max Locktime Boost (180 days)) is: 126,144,000 x 1.533 = **193,416,595.20 ZOO**
*   We add these two together to get: 126,144,000 + 193,416,595.20 = **319,560,595.20 ZOO**
*   Finally, add to this the OTT of 23% (see breakdown further down for details) which is: 319,560,595.20 x 0,23 = **73,498,936.896 ZOO**
*   This gives us an estimated maximum cap total of **393,059,532.10 ZOO**, minted over a period of 24 months.

This article makes it clear that reaching the maximum cap with the maximum boost rewards and maximum lock period is impossible. From there, the ZooKeeper team predicted an estimated market cap based on all features available within the ZooKeeper farming environment. **This can fluctuate to anywhere between 180,000,000 and 230,000,000. That is why we call it a ‘dynamic’ market cap.**

_The OTT (Over The Top) breakdown is as follows:_

100% will be reserved for the farming pools and is subject to the dynamic calculation below:

OTT +9% will be kept for the ZooKeeper foundation  
OTT +8% will be dedicated to marketing  
OTT +3% will be reserved for advisors  
OTT +3% will be reserved for the SAFARI Staking Pools
