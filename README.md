### What is Wanchain?
Wanchain is a public blockchain with support for the development of smart contracts using Solidity. Wanchain supports ring signature based private transactions and decentralized cross chain functionality.

Wanchain's [Storeman node](technology/storeman.md) system uniquely combines  secure multiparty computation, atomic swaps, threshold secret sharing, and decentralized account management to implement a decentralized cross chain solution.

A developer can write smart contracts, build a DAPP or issue a fungible/non-fungible token on wanchain. 

Through Wanchain's cross chain features, it is possible for any blockchain's assets to be connected with and circulate on Wanchain. This includes assets from public, private, as well as consortium chains.


### Vision - Making Cross-Chain DeFi a Reality

Our vision is a world where assets can flow freely between blockchains without any centralized third party controlling the process. Wanchain's network of decentralized Storeman Nodes work together to manage the exchange of assets and information between blockchains without ever being able to take custody or direct control over the assets and information they interact with. In this world, assets from different blockchain may easily mingle and interact with each other inside decentralized financial (DeFi) applications (DApps) on the same chain. After being used in a DeFi DApp, the assets may then be withdrawn back to its native blockchain or sent to a new blockchain to be used in a different DApp. In addition to assets, information will also be able to flow freely and securely between chains without a centralized third party. This allows for powerful financial applications in which events on one blockchain can trigger events on another blockchain. For example, a user may use his BTC on Bitcoin as collateral in order to generate a loan of tokenized USD directly on Ethereum, and the entire process will be managed in a decentralized, permissionless, and trustless way through the Storeman Node network and the Wanchain blockchain.
