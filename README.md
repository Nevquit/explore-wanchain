## What is Wanchain?

Wanchain is a public blockchain with support for the development of smart contracts using Solidity. Wanchain supports ring signature based private transactions and decentralized cross chain functionality.

Wanchain has been building its cross-chain infrastructure since 2017. In early 2021, it launched the world’s 1st decentralized BTC-ETH direct bridge. Wanchain also offers decentralized bridges connecting Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and EOS, with other chains such as Polkadot on the horizon. All of Wanchain’s different cross-chain bridges are supported by unified decentralized collateral pools.


Wanchain features two types of validator nodes: PoS validator nodes and Storeman validator nodes. PoS validator nodes use a Proof-of-Stake to achieve decentralised consensus. Storeman validator nodes perform and verify cross-chain transactions.

A developer can write smart contracts, build a DAPP or issue a fungible/non-fungible token on wanchain. 

Through Wanchain's cross chain features, it is possible for any blockchain's assets to be connected with and circulate on Wanchain. This includes assets from public, private, as well as consortium chains.


## Vision - Making Cross-Chain DeFi a Reality

Our vision is a world where assets can flow freely between blockchains without any centralized third party controlling the process. Wanchain's network of decentralized Storeman Nodes work together to manage the exchange of assets and information between blockchains without ever being able to take custody or direct control over the assets and information they interact with. In this world, assets from different blockchain may easily mingle and interact with each other inside decentralized financial (DeFi) applications (DApps) on the same chain. After being used in a DeFi DApp, the assets may then be withdrawn back to its native blockchain or sent to a new blockchain to be used in a different DApp. In addition to assets, information will also be able to flow freely and securely between chains without a centralized third party. This allows for powerful financial applications in which events on one blockchain can trigger events on another blockchain. For example, a user may use his BTC on Bitcoin as collateral in order to generate a loan of tokenized USD directly on Ethereum, and the entire process will be managed in a decentralized, permissionless, and trustless way through the Storeman Node network and the Wanchain blockchain.

## 2021 Plan

- Major upgrade to cross-chain mechanism in order to improve node operator economics and scalability
- Wide array of new asset and public blockchain integrations
- Establish DeFi ecosystem which takes advantage of Wanchain’s cross-chain infrastructure.

*All roadmap items are subject to change.*
